Embedded videos, critical thinking exercises, and explorations of external programming tools\\nand activities all contribute to a meaningful and supportive learning experience.\\nThe content is organized in chapters, with each chapter containing 6-8 sections. Each section follows the\\npattern:\\n• Learning objectives\\n• 1–3 subsections\\n• Programming practice\\nThe learning objectives are designed to help readers identify the section\\'s focus.

The subsection begins with a concise introduction to the\\nconcept, with key term definitions and brief context for its relevance and importance. The concept is then\\nexplained in detail using video-based animations and interactive learning questions.\\nAnimation videos use a step-by-step approach to show the execution of Python code. Explanations for each\\nstep describe Python syntax, show how fundamental programming concepts are used, illustrate how variables\\nare assigned, emphasize how code executes line by line, apply problem solving to create programs, and more.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nDisplaying output to the user\\nAccess multimedia content (https://www.openstax.org/r/displaying-output)\\nLearning questions\\nAfter introducing a new concept and explaining the concept with a video-based animation, each subsection\\nincludes engagement in the form of learning questions.

Incorrect answers\\' explanations include why the answer is\\nincorrect and help guide the reader to the correct answer.\\nIncorrect answer choices typically represent a misconception or are the result of making a common mistake.\\nEven if the correct answer is achieved, readers are encouraged to explore the explanations to gain awareness\\nof these common misconceptions.\\nProgramming practice exercises\\nEach section ends with 1 or 2 practice programs.

Examples of computers include\\nsmartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and servers. Technically, a program is a sequence of instructions that\\na computer can run. Programs help people accomplish everyday tasks, create new technology, and have fun.\\nThe goal of this book is to teach introductory programming and problem solving. Writing programs is a\\ncreative activity, inherently useful, and rewarding! No prior background in computer science is necessary to\\nread this book.

Example libraries that\\nprovide access to online streaming services include Spotipy (https://openstax.org/r/100spotipy), Pytube\\n(https://openstax.org/r/100pytube), and Pydora (https://openstax.org/r/100pydora). Python-related tools\\noften have the letters \"py\" in their name.\\nThe Python language\\nThis book introduces Python (https://openstax.org/r/100python), one of the top programming languages\\ntoday. Leading tech giants like Google, Apple, NASA, Instagram, Pixar, and others use Python extensively.\\nOne reason why Python is popular is because many libraries exist for doing real work. A library is a collection\\nof code that can be used in other programs. Python comes with an extensive Standard Library\\n(https://openstax.org/r/100pythlibrary) for solving everyday computing problems like extracting data from files\\nand creating summary reports. In addition, the community develops many other libraries for Python. Ex:\\nPandas (https://openstax.org/r/100pandas) is a widely used library for data analysis.\\nAnother reason why Python is popular is because the syntax is concise and straightforward. The syntax of a\\nlanguage defines how code must be structured. Syntax rules define the keywords, symbols, and formatting\\nused in programs. Compared to other programming languages, Python is more concise and straightforward.\\nEXAMPLE 1.1\\nHello world in Python and Java\\nBy tradition, Hello World (https://openstax.org/r/100helloworld) is the first program to write when learning\\na new language. This program simply displays the message \"Hello, World!\"to the user. The hello world\\nprogram is only one line in Python:\\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\\nIn contrast, the hello world program is five lines in Java (a different language).\\npublic class Hello {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\\n}\\n}\\nHowever, conciseness is not the only consideration for which language is used. In different situations\\ndifferent languages may be more appropriate. Ex: Java is often used in Android development.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nCounting lines in a file\\nAccess multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/\\n1-1-background)\\n1.1 • Background 9'),\n",

Even experienced programmers make mistakes when\\nwriting code. Errors may result when mistakes are made when writing code. The computer requires very\\nspecific instructions telling the computer what to do. If the instructions are not clear, then the computer does\\nnot know what to do and gives back an error.\\nWhen an error occurs, Python displays a message with the following information:\\n1. The line number of the error.\\n2. The type of error (Ex: SyntaxError).\\n3. Additional details about the error.\\nEx: Typing print \"Hello!\"without parentheses is a syntax error. In Python, parentheses are required to use\\nprint. When attempting to run print \"Hello!\", Python displays the following error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"/home/student/Desktop/example.py\", line 1\\nprint \"Hello\"\\n^\\nSyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to \\'print\\'. Did you mean print(\"Hello\")?\\nThe caret character (^) shows where Python found the error. Sometimes the error may be located one or two\\nlines before where the caret symbol is shown because Python may not have discovered the error until then.\\nTraceback is a Python report of the location and type of error. The word traceback suggests a programmer\\ntrace back in the code to find the error if the error is not seen right away.\\nLearning to read error messages carefully is an important skill. The amount of technical jargon can be\\noverwhelming at first. But this information can be very helpful.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nIncorrect variable name\\nAccess multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/\\n1-6-error-messages)\\n24 1 • Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In 1982, Guido van Rossum (https://openstax.org/r/100vanRossum), the\\ncreator of Python, started working at CWI (https://openstax.org/r/100CWI), a Dutch national research institute.\\nHe joined a team that was designing a new programming language, named ABC, for teaching and prototyping.\\nABC\\'s simplicity was ideal for beginners, but the language lacked features required to write advanced\\nprograms.\\nSeveral years later, van Rossum joined a different team at CWI working on an operating system. The team\\nneeded an easier way to write programs for monitoring computers and analyzing data. Languages common in\\nthe 1980\\'s were (and still are) difficult to use for these kinds of programs. van Rossum envisioned a new\\nlanguage that would have a simple syntax, like ABC, but also provide advanced features that professionals\\nwould need.\\nAt first, van Rossum started working on this new language as a hobby during his free time. He named the\\nlanguage Python because he was a fan of the British comedy group Monty Python (https://openstax.org/r/\\n100MontyPython). Over the next year, he and his colleagues successfully used Python many times for real\\nwork. van Rossum eventually decided to share Python with the broader programming community online. He\\nfreely shared Python\\'s entire source code so that anyone could write and run Python programs.\\nPython\\'s first release, known as Version 0.9.0, appeared in 1991, about six years after C++ and four years\\nbefore Java. van Rossum\\'s decisions to make the language simple yet advanced, suitable for everyday tasks,\\nand freely available online contributed to Python\\'s long-term success.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nKey decisions\\nAccess multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-8-why-\\npython)\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nPython history\\n1.

Python started out as a hobby and became open source after several years of development.\\nc. van Rossum posted Python\\'s source code online after working on the language for one year.\\nEXPLORING FURTHER\\nFor more details about Python\\'s history, see \"A brief history of Python (https://openstax.org/r/100history)\"\\nby Vasilisa Sheromova, and \"History and Philosophy of Python (https://openstax.org/r/100sheromova)\" by\\nBernd Klein.\\nPopularity of Python\\nOver the years, Python has become a nonprofit organization with a thriving community. Millions of\\nprogrammers around the world use Python for all kinds of interesting projects. Hundreds of thousands of\\nPython libraries have been released as open source software. The Python community is very active and\\nsupportive online, answering questions and sharing code.\\nOne way to see Python\\'s popularity is the TIOBE index (https://openstax.org/r/100TIOBE). TIOBE is a Dutch\\ncompany that provides products and services for measuring software code quality. Since 2001, TIOBE has\\ntracked the popularity of programming languages and posted the results online. Figure 1.2 shows the TIOBE\\nindex over time for five of the most popular languages.\\nThe TIOBE index is based on the number of search engine results for each language. The percentage refers to\\nhow many results belong to that language. Python has been among the top 10 languages every year since\\n2004. In October 2021, Python became the #1 language on the TIOBE index. No other language but C and Java\\nhad been #1 for the previous 20 years.\\nAnother way to see Python\\'s popularity is to analyze how frequently Python is discussed online. Stack Overflow\\n(https://openstax.org/r/100overflow) is a question-and-answer website for programmers. Figure 1.3 shows the\\nnumber of questions asked each month that were tagged with Python, JavaScript, and so forth. In recent\\nyears, Python has become the most asked about language in programming forums.\\n32 1 • Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In Python, many statements\\nconsist of one or more expressions. An expression represents a single value to be computed. Ex: The\\nexpression 3*x - 5evaluates to 7when xis 4. Learning to recognize expressions opens the door for\\nprogramming all kinds of interesting calculations.\\nExpressions are often a combination of literals, variables, and operators. In the previous example, 3and 5are\\nliterals, xis a variable, and *and -are operators. Expressions can be arbitrarily long, consisting of many\\ncalculations. Expressions can also be as short as one value. Ex: In the assignment statement x = 5, the literal\\n5is an expression.\\nThe Statements chapter introduced simple expressions like 1 * 2and \"Hi \" + \"there\". This chapter\\nexplores other kinds of expressions for working with numbers and strings. The first section shows a great way\\nto experiment with expressions using a Python shell. Later sections present more details about integers and\\nfloating-point numbers, explain how to import and use the mathmodule, and show how to make long lines of\\ncode easier to read.\\nExpressions\\n2'),\n",

Programs\\nwritten in high-level languages must be translated into machine code to run. This translation process can\\nhappen all at once, or a little at a time, depending on the language.\\nPython is an interpreted language: the source code is translated one line at a time while the program is\\nrunning. The Python interpreter translates source code into machine code and runs the resulting program. If\\nand when an error occurs, the interpreter stops translating the source code and displays an error message.\\nMost development environments include a Python shell for experimenting with code interactively. A shell, also\\ncalled a console or terminal, is a program that allows direct interaction with an interpreter. The interpreter\\nusually runs an entire program all at once.

Precedence rules provide the\\npriority level of operators. Operators with the highest precedence execute first. Ex: 1 + 2 * 3is 7because\\nmultiplication takes precedence over addition.

In each iteration, if 10is\\nobserved, the statement \"Found 10!\"is printed and the execution can terminate using a break statement. If\\n10is not in the list, the loop terminates when all integers in the list are evaluated, and hence the else\\nstatement will run and print \"10 is not in the list.\"Alternatively, a Boolean variable can be used to\\ntrack whether number 10is found after loop\\'s execution terminates.\\nEXAMPLE 5.4\\nFinding the number 10 in a list\\nIn the code examples below, the code on the left prints \"Found 10!\"if the variable i\\'s value is 10.

Ex: The HTML code\\n<p style=\"color: Red\">Look out!</p>represents a paragraph with red text.\\nHTML defines 140 standard color names (https://openstax.org/r/100colornames). Additional colors can be\\nspecified using a hexadecimal format: #RRGGBB. The digits RR, GG, and BB represent the red, green, and blue\\ncomponents of the color. Ex: #DC143Cis 220 red + 20 green + 60 blue, which is the color Crimson.\\nRed, green, and blue values range from 0 to 255 (or 00 to FF in hexadecimal). Lower values specify darker\\ncolors, and higher values specify lighter colors.

For a string variable s, the left-most character is indexed 0 and the right-most character is\\nindexed len(s) - 1. Ex: The length of the string \"Cloud\"is 5, so the last index is 4.\\nNegative indexing can also be used to refer to characters from right to left starting at -1. For a string variable\\ns, the left-most character is indexed -len(s)and the right-most character is indexed -1.

In the function\\'s recursive case, the argument passed to factorial()is n - 1,\\nwhich is smaller than n.\\nA value of nfor which the solution is known is called the base case. The base case stops the recursion. A\\nrecursive algorithm must include a base case; otherwise, the algorithm may result in an infinite computation.\\nTo calculate a factorial, a recursive function, factorial()is defined with an integer input parameter, n. When\\nn > 1, the recursive case applies. The factorial()calls itself with a smaller argument, n - 1. When n ==\\n1, the solution is known because 1!is 1; therefore, n == 1is a base case.\\nNote: 0!is defined to be 1; therefore, n == 0is a second base case for factorial(). When n < 1, an error\\nis returned.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nFactorial using recursion\\nAccess multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/\\n12-2-simple-math-recursion)\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nProgramming recursion\\nFor the questions below, the function rec_fact()is another recursive function that calculates a factorial.\\nWhat is the result of each definition of rec_fact()if n = 17is the initial input parameter?\\n5. def rec_fact(n):\\nreturn n * rec_fact(n - 1)\\na. 355687428096000\\nb. 0\\nc. no result / infinite computation\\n6. def rec_fact(n):\\nif n < 0:\\nprint(\"error\")\\n290 12 • Recursion\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Once the data are cleaned, data scientists can perform data analysis, which is shared with\\nstakeholders using reports and presentations. The data analysis stage involves using data to generate\\ninsights or make a predictive model. Data science is increasingly being adopted in many different fields, such\\nas healthcare, economics, education, and social sciences, to name a few.

Slicing can be\\nperformed using ranges, lists, or Boolean conditions.\\n• Slicing using ranges: Ex: df.loc[start_row:end_row, start_column:end_column]selects rows and\\ncolumns within the specified ranges.\\n• Slicing using a list: Ex: df.loc[[label1, label2, ...], :]selects rows that are in the list [label1,\\nlabel2, ...]and includes all columns since all columns are selected by the colon operator.\\n• Slicing based on a condition: df[condition]selects only the rows that meet the given condition.\\nData filtering involves selecting rows or columns based on certain conditions. Ex: In the expression\\ndf[df[\\'column_name\\'] > threshold], the DataFrame dfis filtered using the selection operator ([]) and\\nthe condition(df[\\'column_name\\'] > threshold) that is passed. All entries in the DataFrame dfwhere the\\ncorresponding value in the DataFrame is Truewill be returned.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nIndexing on a flight dataset\\nAccess multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/\\n15-4-exploratory-data-analysis)\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nDataFrame slicing and filtering\\nGiven the following code, respond to the questions.\\nimport pandas as pd\\n# Create sample data\\ndata = {\\n\"A\": [1, 2, 3, 4],\\n\"B\": [5, 6, 7, 8],\\n\"C\": [9, 10, 11, 12]\\n}\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\\n4.

Identifying and\\nremoving missing values is an important step in data cleaning and preprocessing. A data scientist should\\nconsider ethical considerations throughout the EDA process, especially when handling missing data. They\\nmight consider answering questions such as \"Why are the data missing?\", \"Whose data are missing?\", and\\n\"Considering the missing data, is the dataset still a representative sample of the population under study?\". The\\nfunctions below are useful in understanding and analyzing missing data.\\n• isnull(): The isnull()function can be used to identify Null entries in a DataFrame. The return value of\\nthe function is a Boolean DataFrame, with the same dimensions as the original DataFrame with True\\nvalues where missing values exist.\\n• dropna(): The dropna()function can be used to drop rows with Nullvalues.\\n• fillna(): The fillna()function can be used to replace Nullvalues with a provided substitute value.\\nEx: df.fillna(df.mean())replaces all Nullvalues with the average value of the specific column.\\nTo define a Nullvalue in a DataFrame, you can use the np.nanvalue from the NumPy library. Functions that\\naid in identifying and removing null entries are described in the table below the following code.\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\n# Create sample data\\ndata = {\\n\"Column 1\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"],\\n\"Column 2\": [np.NAN, 200, 500, 0, -10],\\n\"Column 3\": [True, True, False, np.NaN, np.NaN]\\n}\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\\n15.4 • Exploratory data analysis 365'),\n",

Many calculations will produce a fractional part. Ex: 46 people with\\n3.0 slices per person will need 138 slices or 17.25 pizzas. int(17.25)is 17 , so adding 1 produces 18\\npizzas, a better estimate to ensure enough pizza is ordered.\\n6. a. y = int(4.5) = 4.

Using an f-string allows the entire output to be specified without commas and extra quote marks.\\n4. a. The format specifier 02dappends a 0 to the front of the integer when the integer is only one digit.\\n5. c. The format specifier \".2f\" (with a period) means fixed-point, rounded to two decimal places.\\n6. b. This format specifier is useful for displaying large amounts of money.\\n3.3 Variables revisited\\n1. b. Each line of the program in the animation is an assignment statement.\\n2. c.

Each inner loop\\'s full execution prints three \"*\" characters, and the outer loop executes twice.\\n3. b. Each line iof the output (i = 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) contains itimes values 1 through 4 .\\nHence, the outer loop executes while i <= 4, and the inner loop iterates overjwhile j\\'s value is less than\\nor equal to 4 .\\n4. a. The outer loop\\'s execution range is 0 , 1 , and 2 ; hence, the outer loop executes three times.\\n5. b. The inner loop is evaluated four times (j = 0, 1 , 2 , and 3 ) for every i\\'s value set by the outer loop.\\nIn the given example i = 0, 1 , and 2 ; hence, the total number of times the inner loop executes is 3 *\\n4 = 12.\\n6. c. The printed output displays three rows with each row idisplaying i* values in the range of 0 to 3 .\\nHence, the code must iterate over row ID in the outer loop, and in each row, iterate over elements\\' ID in\\nthe range of 0 to 3 .\\n5.4 Break and continue\\n1. c. The code prints all characters before the first occurrence of a space character in separate lines. Hence\\nthe output is:\\nH\\ne\\nl\\nl\\no\\n2. b. As soon as the print statement is executed, the break statement causes the loop\\'s termination. Also,\\nfor i = 15, the condition (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0)is met, and hence the print statement will be\\nexecuted exactly once.\\n3. b. The loop finds the first five numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3 . These numbers are 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ,\\nand 8 , and thus 8 is the final i\\'s value.\\n4. b. The print statement is executed for numbers within the range of 0 and 10 (inclusive) that are divisible by\\n3. The printed output is:\\n9\\n6\\n3\\n0\\n5. b. The loop checks whether the character being evaluated is a space character or not. If so, the remainder\\nof the loop will be skipped and the space character will not be printed.\\n5.5 Loop else\\n1. b. The variable iis initialized to 16 , and the while loop executes with i = 16, 8 , 4 , and 2 . In each\\nloop\\'s iteration, the variable exp\\'s value is incremented by 1. Hence, at the end of the loop, exp = 4. Since\\nthe loop terminates without interruption, the else statement after the loop is executed and prints 16 is\\n2 to the 4.\\n2. a. The initial i\\'s value is 7 . Hence, in the first loop\\'s iteration, the else statement within the loop\\nexecutes, and the break statement terminates the loop. Since the loop\\'s execution is interrupted, the\\nelse after the loop will not execute and there will be no output.\\n3. b. The loop iterates over all integer values in the list.

The revised program\\nperforms three calculations by executing the four input statements multiple times with function calls.\\n9. c. The benefits of a function\\'s reusability is highlighted by many function calls that drastically reduce the\\namount of cluttered, redundant code.

Since a\\'s ASCII value is less than b\\'s ASCII value, the output for \"aaa\" < \"aab\"is True.\\n2. b. Since \"a\" is shorter than \"aa\" , and the prefix \"aa\" with length 1 equals the second operand ( \"a\"\\n), the shorter string is considered smaller. As such, \"aa\" < \"a\"evaluates to False.\\n3. c. While all characters in \"aples\" exist in \"apples\" , the characters are not sequential, so the string\\n\"aples\" is not a substring of \"apples\" . Therefore, \"aples\" in \"apples\" returns False.\\n4. a. \"aBbA\".lower()converts all characters to lowercase, and the output is \"abba\" .\\n5. b. \"aBbA\".upper()converts all characters to uppercase, and the output is \"ABBA\" .\\n6. a. The upper()converts \"a\" to uppercase ( \"A\" ). When checking \"a\".upper() == \"A\", the output is\\nTrue.\\n8.2 String slicing\\n1. b.

Character \"e\" in the string \"chance\" has index of -1 (negative indexing) and 5 (positive indexing).\\n4. b. a_string[2:4]is a slice including the third and fourth characters, which is \"ll\" .\\n5. b. The slice [-3:-1]includes characters at index -3 and -2, which are \"oo\" .\\n6. b. The string slice of greeting[3:]is the substring starting from index 3 up to the end of the string,\\nwhich is \"Leila\" .\\n7. b. To modify string content, a new variable must be created with desired modifications.\\n8. a.

The arguments for the format()function are passed in order and will be substituted for the\\nreplacement fields. Additional arguments may be ignored by the template and remain unused.\\n4. c. \"Bengio\" is substituted in the named replacement field associated with the tag name; hence, the\\noutput is \"Hey Bengio!\" .\\n5. b. Since the string template uses a named argument, inputs are only accepted through the corresponding\\nkeys. Hence, the code generates KeyError: \\'name\\'.\\n6. b. The greeting variable with value \"Hi\" is substituted for the greeting replacement field. The same is\\nalso done for the name replacement field and the name variable. The output is \"Hi Jess\" .\\n7. b. The template specifies the minimum length for the namefield to be 12, so len(formatted_name)is 12\\n.\\n8. c.

The values in the numbers dictionary are 1 , 2 , and 3 . When printing numbers.values(),\\ndict_values([1, 2, 3])is printed.\\n6. b. Keys in the dictionary are \"one\", \"two\", \"three\". Using the list()constructor, a list object\\ncontaining all keys is returned.\\n7. c. When accessing a dictionary key and assigning a new value, the associated value for the key will be\\nupdated.\\n8. b. Using the del keyword, items can be deleted from a dictionary using the key.\\n9. a. The update()function modifies the value associated with the key \"Kabob\" and adds a new item,\\n\"Sushi\": \"$16\".\\n10.4 Conditionals and looping in dictionaries\\n1. a. \"apple\" is a key in the dictionary and exists in the returned keys from fruit_count.keys().\\n2. b. The key \"orange\" , with associated value 5 , exists in the dictionary and the return value is True .\\n3. b. Conditional statements can be written to examine keys and values.\\n4. b.

One step is needed to move the biggest ring from the\\nsource to the target. It takes seven more steps move three smaller rings from the middle to the target. The\\ntotal is 7 + 1 + 7 = 15 steps.\\n12.2 Simple math recursion\\n1. The summation can be calculated using recursion because there is a regular pattern and the summation\\nto ndepends on the summation to n - 1.\\n2. Each number in the sequence can be found by adding 2 to the previous number, with the solution at 1\\nbeing 1 .\\n3. A prime number does not depend on a smaller prime number; thus, no recursion can be found to\\ngenerate new prime numbers based on an existing list of prime numbers.\\n4. A given number in the Fibonacci sequence is found by summing the previous two numbers in the\\nsequence, so the Fibonacci sequence can be found recursively.\\n5. c. There is a missing base case, so there is no place for the recursion to end.\\n6. b. This definition of rec_fact()uses a base case of n == 0, which works because, just like 1!, 0! = 1.\\nHowever, the base case of n == 0returns n, which at this stage is 0 , and therefore zeroes out the rest of\\nthe computation.\\n7. a. The recursive function begins returning correctly at the base case of n == 0. 0! = 1.\\n8. b. The base case of n == 1is not used in the function. When nis 0 , the overall multiplication becomes 0\\n. The recursion begins returning once the n < 0base case is reached, initially returning -1. But the\\nprevious recursive call would return 0 , thereby zeroing out all computations and leaving an overall result\\nof 0 .\\n12.3 Recursion with strings and lists\\n1. b. Once changed to all lower case, the word \"madam\" is a palindrome, so the function will recognize the\\nword as a palindrome.\\n2. a. When a palindrome has an even number of letters, eventually an empty string is left as pairs of letters\\nare removed. Thus, the base case should include len(word) == 0, which is resolved with the condition\\nlen(word) <= 1.\\n3. b. The strip()function removes a given letter from the beginning and end of the string, including\\nrepeated letters. When strip(\\'m\\')is used with \"madamm\" , the resultant string is \"ada\" .\\n4. a. Both lists have the same items in a different order.\\n5. b. The two lists have four overlapping items, but list_numhas an extra 15, and other_listhas an extra\\n22.\\n6. a. Both lists have the same items in a different order. The function works for items of any type.\\n7. a. Both lists have the same items in a different order. The function works for items of any type, including\\nother lists.\\n8. a. Both lists have the same items in the same order.\\n12.4 More math recursion\\n1. c. fib(9)= fib(8)+ fib(7). fib(9)= fib(8) + fib(7) = 21 + 13 = 34.\\n2. c. There are eight calls to base cases as seen in the animation. Those calls result in the recursion returning\\nand the final value being computed.\\n3. b. The structure that shows which function calls are made is called a recursion tree. A recursion tree can be\\nused to trace how the final values are computed.\\n4. c. 5 * 3 = 15and 5 * 7 = 35, so 5 is a the greatest common divisor of 15 and 35 .\\n5. a. The first call gcd(24, 30)results in 30 - 24 = 6, so the next call is gcd(24, 6). Thereafter, other\\ncalls are gcd(18, 6), gcd(12, 6), and gcd (6,6)for a total of four recursive calls after the initial\\nfunction call.\\n397'),\n",

Thereafter, other\\ncalls are gcd(10, 3), gcd(7, 3), gcd (4,3), gcd(3,2), gcd(2,1), and gcd(1,1)for a total of eight\\ncalls.\\n12.5 Using recursion to solve problems\\n1. c. This array is sorted in ascending order, as is required for using the binary search algorithm.\\n2. a. mid = (4 + 7) // 2 = 11 // 2 = 5. The operator // is used for floor division.\\n3. a. The first call results in midbeing 3 , next midbecomes 5 , and finally, midbecomes 4 . The element\\nfound at index 4 is equal to the key 16 .\\n4. a. The first call results in midbeing (0 + 13) // 2 = 6. The next call has mid (7 + 13) // 2 = 10.\\nThe next call has mid (11 + 13) // 2 = 12.

However, inducing language model rationale generation cur-\\nrently requires either constructing massive rationale datasets or sacriﬁcing accuracy\\nby using only few-shot inference. We propose a technique to iteratively leverage a\\nsmall number of rationale examples and a large dataset without rationales, to boot-\\nstrap the ability to perform successively more complex reasoning. This technique,\\nthe \"Self-Taught Reasoner\" (STaR), relies on a simple loop: generate rationales to\\nanswer many questions, prompted with a few rationale examples; if the generated\\nanswers are wrong, try again to generate a rationale given the correct answer; ﬁne-\\ntune on all the rationales that ultimately yielded correct answers; repeat. We show\\nthat STaR signiﬁcantly improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a\\nmodel ﬁne-tuned to directly predict ﬁnal answers, and performs comparably to ﬁne-\\ntuning a 30× larger state-of-the-art language model on CommensenseQA. Thus,\\nSTaR lets a model improve itself by learning from its own generated reasoning.\\n1 Introduction\\nHuman decision-making is often the result of extended chains of thought [1, 2]. Recent work has\\nshown that explicit intermediate reasoning (“rationales”) can improve large language model (LLM)\\nperformance as well [ 3–8]. For example, [ 5] demonstrated that LLMs explicitly trained to use\\n“scratchpads” for intermediate steps can attain perfect in-distribution performance on arithmetic,\\nand strong out-of-distribution generalization, while models trained to predict answers directly fail\\nto do either. These works suggest that generating explicit rationales before giving a ﬁnal answer\\n(“rationale generation”) is valuable for LLMs across diverse tasks including mathematical reasoning,\\ncommonsense reasoning, code evaluation, social bias inference, and natural language inference.\\nHowever, the two primary methods for inducing rationale generation both have serious drawbacks.\\nOne approach to rationale generation is the construction of a ﬁne-tuning dataset of rationales, either\\nmanually by human annotators or automatically with hand-crafted templates [ 3–5, 9]. Manual\\nmethods are expensive, and it is infeasible to construct such a dataset for each interesting problem\\n[3]. Meanwhile, template-based methods rely on automatically-generated rationales but only work\\nwhen a general solution is already known [5] or reasonable hard-coded heuristics can be made [4].\\nAn alternative is to leverage in-context learning by including only a few rationale examples in the\\nlanguage model prompt. This has been shown to improve accuracy on mathematical and symbolic\\nreasoning tasks relative to prompting without rationales (“direct” prompting) [ 5, 6]. Yet, while few-\\nshot techniques with rationales tend to outperform their non-reasoning counterparts, they generally\\nsubstantially underperform models ﬁne-tuned to directly predict answers using larger datasets [5, 6].\\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\\narXiv:2203.14465v2  [cs.LG]  20 May 2022'),\n",

We indicate\\nthe ﬁne-tuning outer loop with a dashed line. The questions and ground truth answers are expected to\\nbe present in the dataset, while the rationales are generated using STaR.\\nIn this paper, we adopt a different approach: by leveraging the LLM’s pre-existing reasoning ability,\\nwe iteratively bootstrap the ability to generate high-quality rationales. Speciﬁcally, we few-shot\\nprompt a large language model to self-generate rationales and reﬁne the model’s ability further by\\nﬁne-tuning on those rationales that lead to correct answers. We repeat this procedure, using the\\nimproved model to generate the next training set each time. This is a synergistic process, where\\nimprovements in rationale generation improve the training data, and improvements in training data\\nfurther improve rationale generation.\\nHowever, we ﬁnd this loop eventually fails to solve any new problems in the training set because it\\nreceives no direct training signal for problems it fails to solve. To overcome this issue, we propose\\nrationalization: for each problem that the model fails to answer correctly, we generate a new rationale\\nby providing the model with the correct answer. This lets the model reason backward—given the\\ncorrect answer, the model can more easily generate a useful rationale. These rationales are then\\ncollected as part of the training data, which often improves overall accuracy.\\nWe thus develop the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Fig. 1) method, a scalable bootstrapping method\\nallowing models to learn to generate their own rationales, while also learning to solve increasingly\\ndifﬁcult problems. In our method, we repeat the following process: in each iteration, ﬁrst construct a\\nﬁnetuning dataset by attempting to solve the dataset using the current model’srationale generation\\nability; then, augment this dataset using rationalization, justifying ground-truth answers to problems\\nthe model failed to solve; ﬁnally, ﬁnetune the large language model on the combined dataset.\\nApplying STaR on arithmetic, math word problems, and commonsense reasoning, we observe it is\\nable to effectively translate a small number of few-shot prompts into a large rationale dataset, yielding\\ndramatic performance improvements. On CommonsenseQA [10], we ﬁnd STaR improves over both\\na few-shot baseline (+35.9%) and a baseline ﬁne-tuned to directly predict answers (+12.5%) , and\\nperforms comparably to a ﬁne-tuned model that is 30× larger (72.5% vs. 73.0%).\\nThus, we make the following contributions:\\n1. We propose a bootstrapping mechanism to iteratively generate a rationale dataset from a few\\ninitial examples with rationales—without needing to check new rationales’ correctness.\\n2. We complement rationale generation with rationalization, where a model is tasked with\\njustifying an answer and then ﬁne-tuned as if it had come up with the rationale without any\\nhint. We show rationalization accelerates and improves the bootstrapping process.\\n3. We evaluate these techniques with a variety of ablations in both mathematical and common-\\nsense reasoning domains.\\n4. We propose what is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst technique to allow a pre-trained large\\nlanguage model to iteratively use its language modeling capacity to improve itself.\\n2'),\n",

In essence, in-context learning treats\\nfew-shot learning as a language modeling problem, by showing a few examples in the context (i.e.\\nprompt), and allowing the model to learn and identify the pattern to apply to new examples. Some\\nhave studied in-context learning based on the language modeling objective in terms of Bayesian\\ninference [13] while others have attempted to describe the process more mechanistically in terms\\nof “induction heads” [ 14]. Moreover, differences in prompt conﬁgurations have been known to have\\ndramatic effects on few-shot performance. Some have even found that replacing few-shot prompts\\nwith a “soft prompt” which can be optimized in embedding space results in noticeable gains [ 15].\\nInstead of emphasizing the representation of the question, we focus on the model output; in particular,\\nwe focus on the model’s ability to reason through a problem before coming to a conclusion.\\nRationales One of the initial works on the impact of rationales on language model performance was\\n[3], showing that training a language model on a dataset with explicit rationales preceding the answer\\ncould improve a model’s ability to generate the ﬁnal answer. However, this required many thousands\\nof training examples to be manually annotated with human reasoning. Recently, [5] demonstrated\\nthat step-by-step “scratchpads” can improve ﬁne-tuned LLM performance and generalization on\\ntasks such as arithmetic, polynomial evaluation, and program evaluation. Similarly, [6] used a single\\nfew-shot “chain-of-thought” reasoning prompt in order to improve model performance on a collection\\nof tasks, without ﬁne-tuning. Finally, [16] showed that a curriculum learning approach could help\\nsolve formal math problems, as long as 1) they were translated into Lean (a theorem-proving language\\n[17]), 2) one could directly evaluate the validity of the proofs, 3) one could sample numerous potential\\nsolutions for each problem, 4) had trained a separate value function model, and 5) started with GPT-f\\n(a model already ﬁne-tuned on a large math dataset [18]). We note that there are many domains where\\nthese conditions do not all apply. In addition, works have aimed to explain why rationales have this\\nbeneﬁcial effect: some have analyzed their impact from the perspective of latent variable models [19]\\nwhile others have provided formal proofs of the beneﬁt of intermediate task supervision [20].\\nIterated Learning A variety of iterated learning algorithms have been proposed, where solutions\\nor successful methods which are found are in turn used to ﬁnd additional solutions [21, 22, 16]. [21]\\nintroduced Expert Iteration (ExIt), a reinforcement learning technique serving as an inspiration for\\nour approach. Essentially, it consists of a loop of self-play by an “apprentice,” followed by imitation\\nlearning with feedback from a slower “expert” and then the replacement of the expert with the now-\\nimproved apprentice. [16] builds off of ExIt for formal reasoning, while [22] applies iterated learning\\nto visual question answering using modular networks which can be combined compositionally. There\\nare further similarities between STaR and expert iteration methods [ 21]. For example, ﬁltering\\ngenerated examples based on whether their ultimate answer matches the target can be seen as expert\\nfeedback. However, we have a ﬁxed “expert” and do not train a separate value function.\\nNatural Language Explanations Natural language explanations have also been discussed from the\\nperspective of explainable machine learning, focusing on justiﬁcation rather than reasoning [23, 24].\\nThe motivation for this line of work is largely grounded in explainable decision making, and similarly\\nto [3], generally does not ﬁnd that requiring post-hoc explanations improves model performance.\\n3 Method\\n3.1 Rationale Generation Bootstrapping (STaR Without Rationalization)\\nWe are given a pretrained LLM M and an initial dataset of problems x with answers y: D =\\n{(xi, yi)}D\\ni=1. Our technique starts with a small prompt set P of examples with intermediate ratio-\\nnales r: P = {(xp\\ni , rp\\ni , yp\\ni )}P\\ni=1, where P ≪ D (e.g. P = 10). Like standard few-shot prompting, we\\nconcatenate this prompt set to each example in D, i.e. xi = (xp\\n1, rp\\n1, yp\\n1, . . . , xp\\nP , rp\\nP , yp\\nP , xi), which\\nencourages the model to produce a rationale ˆri for xi followed by an answer ˆyi. We assume that\\nrationales that lead to correct answers are of better quality than those that lead to incorrect answers.\\nTherefore, we ﬁlter the generated rationales to include only the ones which result in the correct\\nanswer (ˆyi = yi). We ﬁne-tune the base modelM on this ﬁltered dataset, and then restart this process\\nby generating the new rationales with the newly ﬁne-tuned model. We keep repeating this process\\nuntil the performance plateaus. Note that during this process, once we collect a new dataset, we train\\nfrom the original pre-trained model M instead of continually training one model to avoid overﬁtting.\\nWe provide an outline of this algorithm in Algorithm 1.\\n3'),\n",

Thus, STaR approximatesJ by (1) greedily\\ndecoding samples of (ˆri, ˆyi) to reduce variance of this estimate (at the cost of potentially biased\\nexploration of rationales), and (2) taking multiple gradient steps on the same batch of data (similar\\nto some policy gradient algorithms [25]). These approximations make STaR a simple and broadly\\napplicable method that can be implemented with standard LLM training machinery; future work\\nshould more closely investigate the link between STaR and the RL objective above.\\n3.2 Rationalization\\nQ: Where do you put your grapes just\\nbefore checking out?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) mouth\\n(b) grocery cart (CORRECT)\\n(c) super market\\n(d) fruit basket\\n(e) fruit market\\nA: The answer should be the place\\nwhere grocery items are placed before\\nchecking out.

Since the model is only trained on\\nthe examples which it answers correctly, improve-\\nment ends when the model fails to solve new prob-\\nlems in the training set. This is fundamentally due\\nto the fact that the algorithm cannot obtain any train-\\ning signal from failed examples. Inspired by [3], we\\npropose a technique we call “rationalization”. Specif-\\nically, we provide the answer as a hint to the model\\nand ask it to generate rationales in the same style\\nas in the previous rationale generation step. Given\\nthe answer, the model is able to reason backwards,\\nand hence more easily generate a rationale that leads\\nto the correct answer. For example, in Figure 2, we\\nprovide the hint that ”(b) grocery cart” is the cor-\\nrect answer in the prompt to generate the rationale.\\nWe apply rationalization to the problems which the\\nmodel failed to solve with rationale generation. When\\nadding a rationalization-generated rationale to our dataset, we do not include the hint in its corre-\\nsponding prompt, as if the model had come up with the rationale without the hint.

In particular, for arithmetic, we follow a setup inspired by [ 5]. For\\ncommonsense question-answering we follow [13, 6] and use CommonsenseQA (CQA), a widely\\nused multiple-choice dataset for this domain [10]. For grade school math, we use GSM8K from [9].\\n4.1 Experimental Protocol\\nWe used GPT-J as our base language model, and the ﬁne-tuning script from the GPT-J repository\\n[26]. We chose GPT-J, a 6B-parameter model, because the checkpoint and ﬁne-tuning code are\\npublicly available [26], and the model is large enough to generate rationales of non-trivial quality to\\nbe bootstrapped from. More hyperparameter details about GPT-J and our ﬁne-tuning are included\\nin Appendix H. Following the default setting of [26], we perform a 100-step learning rate warmup,\\nfrom which point we use a constant learning rate. Unless stated otherwise, we start with 40 training\\nsteps at the ﬁrst outer loop, and increase the number of ﬁne-tuning training steps by20% with each\\nouter loop. In general, we found that training more slowly at the beginning ultimately beneﬁts\\nmodel performance. We expect that further improvement is possible via a thorough hyperparameter\\nsearch—we leave this to future work due to computational constraints.\\nFor arithmetic problems, we ﬁrst generate a dataset of 50,000 randomly sampled questions (uniformly\\nover the digit lengths) in the format introduced by [5]. For each outer loop iteration on arithmetic,\\nwe sample 10,000 problems from the dataset. We use 10 random few-shot rationale examples for\\neach digit for its corresponding few-shot prompt. For each of the 9, 741 questions in the training set\\nof CommonsenseQA, we add the question to the few-shot rationale prompt, and prompt the model\\nto generate the rationale and answer for that question. For few shot prompting on CQA, we start\\nwith the same 10 questions as used in [ 6], with the rationales modiﬁed slightly to ﬁx an incorrect\\nanswer and to more explicitly reference relevant knowledge. We include these modiﬁed prompts in\\nAppendix B1. These prompts serve as our complete set of explanations. We run STaR until we see\\nperformance saturate, and we report the best results.\\nWhen performing rationalization, we ﬁnd that the choice to include or omit few-shot prompts on\\nouter-loop iterations after the ﬁrst iteration does not have a substantial impact on the method’s ultimate\\nperformance. However, there are some nuances which we discuss further in Section 5, leading us to\\nuse few-shot prompts unless stated otherwise.\\n4.2 Datasets\\nInput:\\n6 2 4 + 2 5 9\\nTarget:\\n<scratch>\\n6 2 4 + 2 5 9 , C: 0\\n2 + 5 , 3 C: 1\\n6 + 2 , 8 3 C: 0\\n, 8 8 3 C: 0\\n0 8 8 3\\n</scratch>\\n8 8 3\\nFigure 3: A visualization of\\na 3-digit arithmetic problem\\nwith a scratchpad.

Everything\\nup to and including “ Target:” is given as part of a prompt, and\\nthe model is asked to generate the scratchpad (start/end indicated\\nby “ <scratch>”) and the ﬁnal answer, as in [5]. Each line of the\\nscratchpad corresponds to the summation of each pair of digits from\\nthe ﬁnal digit to the ﬁrst digit, the accumulating ﬁnal digits of the\\nanswer, and a carry digit corresponding to whether the previous pair\\nsummed to at least 10. We include few-shot prompts for 1 to 5 digits.\\nWhen performing rationalization, we include the correct answer after\\n“ Target” and query the model to produce the scratchpad and then\\nreproduce the correct answer following the scratchpad.\\nCommonsenseQA The multiple-choice commonsense reasoning\\ntask, CommonsenseQA [10] (CQA), is constructed from ConceptNet, a semantic graph of concepts\\nand their relationships with over a million nodes [28]. [10] identiﬁed a set of “target” concepts in\\nConceptNet for each question, where the target concepts share a semantic relationship to one “source”\\nconcept. Then each question is crowdsourced to allow a reader to identify one target concept, while\\nmentioning the source concept. In addition, two distractor answers are added.

In the arithmetic task,\\nan incorrect scratchpad in the reasoning step, and to a lesser degree in the rationalization step, was\\nextremely likely to result in an incorrect answer. On the other hand, CQA problems are 5-way\\nmultiple choice questions. Thus, one will get the right answer at random approximately 20% of\\nthe time, regardless of the quality of reasoning. Moreover, some simple heuristics (e.g. semantic\\nsimilarity) can meaningfully improve this to ≈30% without any reasoning, as shown by [10].\\nWe evaluate this dataset as described in the experimental protocol and compare to several baselines.\\nThe ﬁrst baseline is to ﬁnetune GPT-J to directly output the ﬁnal answer, which we call “GPT-J\\nFinetuned”. We also compare to GPT-3 ﬁnetuned to directly predict the ﬁnal answer from [29], and a\\n137B parameter Lambda model few-shot prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from [6].\\nWe found that, as shown in Table 1, STaR without rationalization outperformed GPT-J ﬁne-tuned\\ndirectly on the ﬁnal answer for the entire dataset, despite training on less of the data. The inclusion of\\nrationalization improved this performance to 72.5%, far closer to the 73% of the 30× larger GPT-3.\\nAs expected, we also see STaR surpassed the few-shot baselines, including the much-larger 137B\\nLaMDA model [30, 6]. We expect accuracy would be further improved if we applied STaR to a\\nmodel with higher few-shot performance.\\nCase Study Note that it is harder to judge the rationale quality: for arithmetic, one can compare\\nthem to the ground truth rationales, but for CQA the evaluation is necessarily qualitative. For this\\nreason, we include a case study in Figure 7. We observe that the rationales provided are generally\\ncoherent and of a similar structure to the few-shot rationales. We make the following two observations:\\n1. After training with STaR, we see the model was able to generate reasonable rationales that\\nsolve new problems, which explains part of the observed performance gain.\\n2. We also see that there were many instances in which STaR improved the quality of rationales\\nover those generated in a few-shot manner.\\nHuman Evaluation Based on the observation that STaR may improve reasoning quality for prob-\\nlems even when they were initially answered correctly via few-shot prompting, we performed a\\npreliminary qualitative analysis. We randomly selected 50 rationales generated from few-shot CoT\\nand STaR-generated rationales on questions which they both answered correctly, as well as human-\\ngenerated rationales for these problems from [3]. We then presented a random subset of 10 questions\\nand rationales to each of 20 crowdworkers on Proliﬁc [31] with the rationales in a randomized order,\\nasking them to rank the rationales based on which they felt best justiﬁed the answer. The participants\\nwere 30% more likely to rank the STaR-generated rationales higher than the few-shot rationales\\n(p = .039). This indicates that, as mentioned in the case study, STaR can improve the quality of\\nrationale generation.\\nWe also found that the participants were 74% more likely to prefer the STaR-generated rationales\\nover the human-generated rationales (p < .001). To be clear, we do not believe that this indicates\\nhuman-level rationale-generation performance. Instead, we feel that it speaks to the difﬁculty of\\neliciting high-quality rationales. We reproduce the test prompts in Appendix C and elaborate on the\\nlimitations of the crowdsourced explanations dataset.\\n3We use the same few-shot rationales as described in Section 4.1 - namely ﬁxing typos and improving clarity.\\n7'),\n",

We observe\\nthat on this task, the use of rationalization does not\\nsubstantially improve performance. Note that, in\\ntraining, it was necessary to cap the number of train-\\ning steps at the 30th iterations (after 7912 steps),\\nto prevent the training process from becoming pro-\\nhibitively long. The results were reached after 36\\niterations for STaR without rationalization and an\\nadditional 10 iterations with rationalization.\\nMost often, the number of calculation steps gen-\\nerated by the model matches the number of steps\\ntaken by humans (generally between 53% and 57%\\nagreement across all iterations). We visualize this\\nexplicitly in Figure 6. We see that when the ground\\ntruth and model disagree on the number of calcu-\\nlation steps, the model typically uses fewer. Sometimes this is because the model skips steps, but\\noccasionally it ﬁnds different solutions. We show an example in Appendix J, where the model\\ndisregards redundant information and solves a 7-step problem in a single step.\\n5 Discussion and Challenges\\nThe Impact of Rationalization An essential question is exactly what role rationalization plays.\\nIntuitively, rationalization allows a model to reverse-engineer a solution, or provides a heuristic for\\nidentifying whether each step makes the conclusion more likely. This parallels real-world problems\\nwhere the ﬁnal result is known, but challenging to derive a good justiﬁcation. From a mathematical\\nperspective, while rationale generation samples rationales from the distribution p(r | x) provided by\\nour model M, rationalization conditions on the answer, letting us access an alternative distribution\\np(r | x, y) which may be a better search space for rationales. Then rationalization could be framed as\\nan off-policy estimate of the objective in Equation 1, sampling from the hint-augmented model as a\\nproposal distribution. Future work should establish more connections between rationalization and\\nthese RL objectives, and examine more generally when and why rationalization improves learning.\\n8'),\n",

This results in these examples\\nproviding a weaker gradient signal than the rationalization examples, at least in the ﬁrst iteration.\\nSince we retrain from the initial pre-trained model every time we run a ﬁne-tuning iteration, the\\ndegree of this effect is also difﬁcult to measure directly. Finally, we must point out that the method\\nto add the “hint” does not follow immediately from the question and answer and in some contexts\\nproviding it may be nontrivial. An exploration of the various impacts of different hinting techniques\\nand their generality is an avenue for future work.\\nTemperature One intuitive alternative to rationalization, if one seeks to expand the training dataset,\\nis more and higher-temperature sampling. However, in practice, we found that this is counterpro-\\nductive. In general, it substantially increases the likelihood of a correct answer despite incorrect\\nreasoning, and training on bad or irrelevant reasoning prevents generalization. This is particularly\\nclear in more structured tasks, like arithmetic, where the scratchpads that the model learns to produce\\nwith a higher-temperature sampling approach diverge into meaninglessness and cause the model to\\nstagnate. Overall, we found that higher temperatures as an alternative to rationalization (e.g. 0.5\\nor 0.7) consistently led to models worse than models with reasoning alone. In addition, as text\\ngeneration by large language models is sequential (i.e. one cannot produce a token without producing\\nthe preceding token), generating text is a bottleneck and this is computationally far less efﬁcient\\nthan rationalization. For example, generating 10 sample outputs is approximately 10 times slower\\nthan generating one sample output. However, one potentially valuable way to leverage multiple\\nsamples would be to use the method proposed in [32], using the majority-vote result of multiple high-\\ntemperature scratchpads as a ground truth against which we compare a low-temperature scratchpad.\\nThis may allow one to apply STaR to a dataset of only questions, without answers.\\nFew-shot Prompting A noteworthy phenomenon is that the inclusion of few-shot prompting during\\nsampling seems to dramatically reduce “drift” where later rationales become increasingly dissimilar\\nfrom the initial few-shot set of rationales. One beneﬁt of this is that the model may be less constrained\\nby the quality and difﬁculty of the initial rationales, theoretically allowing it to generalize more. One\\npotentially negative consequence is that the style of the rationales may less-closely match the original\\nprompting style. Another beneﬁt is in terms of computational resources - a shorter prompt length\\nallows for a shorter sequence length when sampling. Technically, the point in training at which we\\n“disable” few-shot prompts is another hyperparameter which we could tune, but we leave this to future\\nwork. In addition, by leaving prompts out after the initial outer-loop iteration, the model tends to\\nperform gradually worse at rationalization as it trains for longer periods of time. As a result, it may\\nbe necessary to include some hints during training for long periods of time with this approach.\\nUltimately, the choice to include few-shot prompts in later iterations of training appears to depend on\\nthe use-case: when the goal is consistent adherence to a particular prompt style, which may beneﬁt\\nexplainability, include few-shot prompts in sampling; when the goal is a faster training loop, one may\\nremove them. Moreover, it is possible that with other datasets or larger models there is an impact on\\nperformance, so we encourage this to be generally treated as a hyperparameter.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe present the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), which iteratively improves a model’s ability to generate\\nrationales to solve problems. We few-shot prompt a model to solve many problems in a step-by-step\\nmanner by generating rationales, and then prompt it to rationalize the correct answer for problems\\nit gets wrong. We ﬁnetune on both the initially correct solutions and rationalized correct solutions,\\nand repeat the process. We ﬁnd that this technique signiﬁcantly improves the model’s generalization\\nperformance on both symbolic reasoning and natural language reasoning.\\nThere are several important limitations on STaR as presented. In order for the ﬁrst iteration of STaR\\nto succeed, few-shot performance must be above chance, implying that the initial model must be\\nbig enough to have some reasoning capabilities. For instance we found that GPT-2 was not able\\nto bootstrap from few-shot reasoning in even the arithmetic domain. A further limitation is that\\nsettings with a high level of chance performance (e.g. binary decisions) yield many poor rationales,\\nconfounding the STaR approach. An open problem is how to ﬁlter bad reasoning in these settings.\\nNonetheless, we believe using examples without reasoning to bootstrap reasoning is a very general\\napproach, and that STaR can serve as the basis of more sophisticated techniques across many domains.\\n9'),\n",

Note that all the ﬁnal answers are correct – however, we take issue with the reasoning\\nused in order to arrive at those answers.\\nA.1 Question Implies Answer\\nOne key failure case was answers in the form of “the answer must be something that is <question\\nproperty>. <answer> is <question property>. Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>.” In these\\ncases, the model fails to explain why the answer that it has chosen satisﬁes the question property.\\nQ: What might someone get from learning about science?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) headache\\n(b) see things differently\\n(c) increased knowledge\\n(d) accidents\\n(e) appreciation of nature\\nA: The answer must be something that someone would get from learning about\\nscience. Learning about science would increase knowledge. Therefore, the\\nanswer is increased knowledge (c).\\nThese rationales, while perhaps useful to the model, read to us as opaque and unexplanatory.\\nA.2 Begging the Question\\nA related but stronger version of the previous failure case, while less common, is particularly\\nuninsightful. Sometimes the model will imply the answer that it has chosen in its question.\\nQ: The christian rock band was on a large stage, the singer’s foot got caught\\non a wire and he had a small what?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) commit sin\\n(b) fail\\n(c) disobey\\n(d) stumble\\n(e) boo boo\\nA: The answer must be something that would cause the singer to stumble. The\\nsinger’s foot got caught on a wire, so he would stumble. Therefore, the\\nanswer is stumble (d).\\nA.3 Exercise to the Reader\\nA rare failure case is when the model ﬁnds it unnecessary to justify its answer. For example:\\nQ: Other than school or from text where can one gain knowledge?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) book\\n(b) class\\n(c) thinking\\n(d) head\\n(e) meeting\\nA: The answer must be a place where someone can gain knowledge other than\\nschool or from text. The answer is meeting (e).\\n13'),\n",

This leads to somewhat comical examples of reasoning. Part of the reason\\nfor this is that generally, there is an expectation that good rationales will leverage understanding of\\nmore general classes of objects and appeal to the relationship between those general classes and the\\nparticular instance. For example, the argument that “a person would typically feel exhilaration from\\nheights” is generally more compelling than the argument that “James would feel exhilaration from\\nheights.”\\nQ: A person’s hand hurts after hitting the bottle. What might happen to\\nthe bottle?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) alcoholism\\n(b) breaking\\n(c) fly\\n(d) nausea\\n(e) ticket\\nA: The answer must be something that happens to the bottle. The bottle is\\nbroken. Therefore, the answer is breaking (b).\\nQ: James loved climbing. What emotion might he feel from heights?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) exhaustion\\n(b) exhilaration\\n(c) falling down\\n(d) nervousness\\n(e) vertigo\\nA: The answer must be a feeling that would cause someone to climb a mountain.\\nJames would feel exhilaration from heights. Therefore, the answer is\\nexhilaration (b).\\nA.5 Red Herrings\\nSome errors in reasoning corresponded to the model making a statement which, while technically\\ntrue, is not useful in demonstrating the claim.\\nQ: A squirrel ran up to it’s home, where is the small dog likely to be\\nbarking up?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) manhattan apartment\\n(b) wood\\n(c) neighbor’s yard\\n(d) tree\\n(e) basket\\nA: The answer must be a place where a small dog would be likely to be\\nbarking. Squirrels are not small dogs. Therefore, the answer is tree (d).\\nQ: John ran very fast, his feet touched the ground in what way?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) behind\\n(b) loose\\n(c) feverishly\\n(d) slowly\\n(e) lightly\\nA: The answer must be a way of running that is different from the way John\\nran. Running is a fast, light-footed activity. Therefore, the answer is\\nlightly (e).\\n14'),\n",

The implication of this with a dataset like CommonsenseQA is that if biases are\\n“useful” in solving the dataset then they will be ampliﬁed. This is made worse by rationalization, as\\nbiased answers that the model may not naturally arrive at are, in a sense, pulled out of the model.\\nThe exact interaction between the bias in a dataset and the pre-existing bias learned by the model\\nis unclear, and something to consider before real-world deployment of all large language models in\\ngeneral, but STaR-trained models in particular.\\nWe ﬁnd some encouraging initial results on this however: for questions where gender is not relevant,\\nthe model appears to disregard it in its explanation. For example: “Q: Where is a good place for\\na woman to store her sunglasses? → A: The answer must be a place where sunglasses are stored.\\nSunglasses are stored in purses. Therefore, the answer is purse (e).” or “Q: The only baggage the\\nwoman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it? → A: The answer must be\\na place where a drawstring bag is checked. The answer is airport (e).” We believe this question\\nwarrants a much more comprehensive study.\\nOne important challenge with models which seek to be interpretable or provide explanations for\\ntheir reasoning is that of faithfulness. While our primary emphasis is not on the explainability\\nbeneﬁts that STaR may bring, there is a fundamental challenge around evaluating explanations\\nand rationales: namely, faithfulness [ 33, 34]. [ 34] describe faithful explanations as those which\\n“accurately [represent] the reasoning process behind the model’s prediction.” While STaR encourages\\nthe use of reasoning in rationales which leads the model to correct answers, it is difﬁcult, if not\\nimpossible, to ensure that the rationales reﬂect the model’s internal processing. For example, it is\\nstraightforward to imagine the model implicitly selecting a particular answer immediately and then\\ngenerating a rationale to justify that selected answer. This would allow a model to generate unbiased\\nrationales while selecting answers in a biased way.\\nThe fact that our model outperforms one ﬁne-tuned to directly predict the answers, and ablation\\nstudies from papers such as [6] make it clear that the generation of a rationale before producing an\\nanswer non-trivially improves the model’s answer quality. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the\\ndegree to which any particular answer’s rationale is faithful. However, we note that there problems\\nare not unique to STaR, but are symptomatic of the difﬁculty of understanding large language models\\nand in particular the rationales generated by large language models.\\nH Hyperparameters\\nGPT-J is a 28-layer decoder-only transformer, with an embedding size of 1024, 16 attention heads of\\ndimension 256, and an FFN hidden layer of size 16384.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\\n3'),\n",

Contributions\\nPost-T raining: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\n• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\\na preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\\nsolving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\\nlong CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\\nfirst open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\\npurely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\\nadvancements in this area.\\n• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\\nstages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\\nerences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and\\nnon-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating\\nbetter models.\\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful T oo\\n• We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller\\nmodels, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered\\nthrough RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit\\nthe research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\\n• Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models\\nthat are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that\\nthe distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Addi-\\ntionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500,\\nand 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-\\nsource models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B,\\n32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\\n1.2.

On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%,\\nperforming on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. (2)\\nOn coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks,\\nas it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in\\nthe competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than\\nDeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks.\\n• Knowledge: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-\\nR1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores\\nof 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its\\nperformance is slightly below that of OpenAI-o1-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1\\nsurpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational\\ntasks.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data ,\\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\\nSpecifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · ·, 𝑜𝐺} from the old\\npolicy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:\\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃) = E[𝑞 ∼ 𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\\n𝑖=1 ∼ 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑂|𝑞)]\\n1\\n𝐺\\n𝐺∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n\\x12\\nmin\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞) 𝐴𝑖, clip\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞) , 1 − 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀\\n\\x13\\n𝐴𝑖\\n\\x13\\n− 𝛽D𝐾 𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃|| 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓\\n\\x01\\x13\\n, (1)\\nD𝐾 𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃|| 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓\\n\\x01 =\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) − log\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) − 1, (2)\\nwhere 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴𝑖 is the advantage, computed using a group of\\nrewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, . . . , 𝑟𝐺} corresponding to the outputs within each group:\\n𝐴𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 − m𝑒𝑎𝑛({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · ·, 𝑟𝐺})\\ns𝑡𝑑 ({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · ·, 𝑟𝐺}) .

Reward Modeling\\nThe reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL.\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two\\ntypes of rewards:\\n• Accuracy rewards: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct.\\nFor example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required\\nto provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable\\nrule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be\\nused to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\\n• Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward\\nmodel that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’\\ntags.\\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,\\nbecause we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale\\nreinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training\\nresources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\\n2.2.3. Training T emplate\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides\\nthe base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template\\nrequires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.\\nWe intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific\\nbiases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-\\ngies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL\\nprocess.\\n2.2.4.

This is also an aha moment for us,\\nallowing us to witness the power and beauty of reinforcement learning.\\nDrawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning\\ncapabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces\\nseveral issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,\\nand language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the\\nopen community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly\\ncold-start data.\\n2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can\\nreasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small\\namount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that\\nnot only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong\\ngeneral capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The\\npipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\\n2.3.1. Cold Start\\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from\\nthe base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data\\nto fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several\\napproaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting\\nmodels to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human\\nannotators.\\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as\\nthe starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data\\n9'),\n",

Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to\\nhighlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1,\\nwe design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and\\nfilters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as\\n|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning\\nprocess is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning\\nresults.\\n• Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we\\nobserve better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is\\na better way for reasoning models.\\n2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale\\nreinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses\\non enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such\\nas coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with\\nclear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,\\nparticularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language\\nmixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated\\nas the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show\\nthat such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward\\naligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of\\nreasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the\\nfinal reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence\\non reasoning tasks.\\n2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT\\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which\\nprimarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the\\nmodel’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we\\ngenerate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\\nReasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-\\ning rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,\\nwe only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,\\nwe expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward\\nmodel by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.\\nAdditionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have\\nfiltered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks. For\\neach prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect\\nabout 600k reasoning related training samples.\\n10'),\n",

For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential\\nchain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries,\\nsuch as “hello” we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of\\napproximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning.\\nWe fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about\\n800k samples.\\n2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios\\nTo further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement\\nlearning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultane-\\nously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination\\nof reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the\\nmethodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the\\nlearning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to\\nreward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build\\nupon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and train-\\ning prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the\\nassessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing\\ninterference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire\\nresponse of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and\\nmitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation\\nprocess. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us\\nto train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.\\n2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability\\nTo equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly\\nfine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using\\nthe 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in §2.3.3. Our findings indicate that\\nthis straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller\\nmodels. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-\\n14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its\\nreasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.\\nFor distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though\\nincorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL\\nstage to the broader research community.\\n3.

In addition to standard benchmarks, we\\nalso evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we\\nadhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li\\net al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we\\nonly feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we\\nreport representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and\\nLiveCodeBench.\\nEvaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as\\nMMLU, DROP , GPQA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-\\nevals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a\\nzero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts\\nare few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot\\nmay hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation\\nprotocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the\\nHumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++,\\nC#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP , and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated\\nusing CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces\\ndataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases,\\nafter which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated.

For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).\\nEvaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models.\\nWe found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in\\nhigher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we\\ndefault to pass@𝑘 evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature.\\nSpecifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top- 𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘\\nresponses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question.

Unsuccessful Attempts\\nIn the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along\\nthe way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that\\nthese approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\\nProcess Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better\\napproaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\\n2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\\nability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\\net al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\\nintroduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\\nMonte Carlo T ree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-\\nver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time\\ncompute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,\\nunlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\\n15'),\n",

To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\\nnode, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\\ndirectly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\\nTraining a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\\nmodel to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to\\nprogressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\\ndue to the complexities of token generation.\\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\\npre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\\nsignificant challenge.\\n5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\\nlearning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\\ndata, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\\nleveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\\nWe further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use\\nDeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small\\ndense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o\\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other\\ndense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-\\ntuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\\n• General Capability: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3\\nin tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output.\\nMoving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in\\nthese fields.\\n• Language Mixing: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which\\nmay result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For\\ninstance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is\\nin a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future\\nupdates.\\n• Prompting Engineering: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive\\nto prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we\\nrecommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a\\nzero-shot setting for optimal results.\\n• Software Engineering T asks: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the effi-\\nciency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software\\nengineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement\\nover DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address\\nthis by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating\\nasynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.\\n16'),\n",

However, inducing language model rationale generation cur-\\nrently requires either constructing massive rationale datasets or sacriﬁcing accuracy\\nby using only few-shot inference. We propose a technique to iteratively leverage a\\nsmall number of rationale examples and a large dataset without rationales, to boot-\\nstrap the ability to perform successively more complex reasoning. This technique,\\nthe \"Self-Taught Reasoner\" (STaR), relies on a simple loop: generate rationales to\\nanswer many questions, prompted with a few rationale examples; if the generated\\nanswers are wrong, try again to generate a rationale given the correct answer; ﬁne-\\ntune on all the rationales that ultimately yielded correct answers; repeat. We show\\nthat STaR signiﬁcantly improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a\\nmodel ﬁne-tuned to directly predict ﬁnal answers, and performs comparably to ﬁne-\\ntuning a 30× larger state-of-the-art language model on CommensenseQA. Thus,\\nSTaR lets a model improve itself by learning from its own generated reasoning.\\n1 Introduction\\nHuman decision-making is often the result of extended chains of thought [1, 2]. Recent work has\\nshown that explicit intermediate reasoning (“rationales”) can improve large language model (LLM)\\nperformance as well [ 3–8]. For example, [ 5] demonstrated that LLMs explicitly trained to use\\n“scratchpads” for intermediate steps can attain perfect in-distribution performance on arithmetic,\\nand strong out-of-distribution generalization, while models trained to predict answers directly fail\\nto do either. These works suggest that generating explicit rationales before giving a ﬁnal answer\\n(“rationale generation”) is valuable for LLMs across diverse tasks including mathematical reasoning,\\ncommonsense reasoning, code evaluation, social bias inference, and natural language inference.\\nHowever, the two primary methods for inducing rationale generation both have serious drawbacks.\\nOne approach to rationale generation is the construction of a ﬁne-tuning dataset of rationales, either\\nmanually by human annotators or automatically with hand-crafted templates [ 3–5, 9]. Manual\\nmethods are expensive, and it is infeasible to construct such a dataset for each interesting problem\\n[3]. Meanwhile, template-based methods rely on automatically-generated rationales but only work\\nwhen a general solution is already known [5] or reasonable hard-coded heuristics can be made [4].\\nAn alternative is to leverage in-context learning by including only a few rationale examples in the\\nlanguage model prompt. This has been shown to improve accuracy on mathematical and symbolic\\nreasoning tasks relative to prompting without rationales (“direct” prompting) [ 5, 6]. Yet, while few-\\nshot techniques with rationales tend to outperform their non-reasoning counterparts, they generally\\nsubstantially underperform models ﬁne-tuned to directly predict answers using larger datasets [5, 6].\\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\\narXiv:2203.14465v2  [cs.LG]  20 May 2022'),\n",

We indicate\\nthe ﬁne-tuning outer loop with a dashed line. The questions and ground truth answers are expected to\\nbe present in the dataset, while the rationales are generated using STaR.\\nIn this paper, we adopt a different approach: by leveraging the LLM’s pre-existing reasoning ability,\\nwe iteratively bootstrap the ability to generate high-quality rationales. Speciﬁcally, we few-shot\\nprompt a large language model to self-generate rationales and reﬁne the model’s ability further by\\nﬁne-tuning on those rationales that lead to correct answers. We repeat this procedure, using the\\nimproved model to generate the next training set each time. This is a synergistic process, where\\nimprovements in rationale generation improve the training data, and improvements in training data\\nfurther improve rationale generation.\\nHowever, we ﬁnd this loop eventually fails to solve any new problems in the training set because it\\nreceives no direct training signal for problems it fails to solve. To overcome this issue, we propose\\nrationalization: for each problem that the model fails to answer correctly, we generate a new rationale\\nby providing the model with the correct answer. This lets the model reason backward—given the\\ncorrect answer, the model can more easily generate a useful rationale. These rationales are then\\ncollected as part of the training data, which often improves overall accuracy.\\nWe thus develop the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Fig. 1) method, a scalable bootstrapping method\\nallowing models to learn to generate their own rationales, while also learning to solve increasingly\\ndifﬁcult problems. In our method, we repeat the following process: in each iteration, ﬁrst construct a\\nﬁnetuning dataset by attempting to solve the dataset using the current model’srationale generation\\nability; then, augment this dataset using rationalization, justifying ground-truth answers to problems\\nthe model failed to solve; ﬁnally, ﬁnetune the large language model on the combined dataset.\\nApplying STaR on arithmetic, math word problems, and commonsense reasoning, we observe it is\\nable to effectively translate a small number of few-shot prompts into a large rationale dataset, yielding\\ndramatic performance improvements. On CommonsenseQA [10], we ﬁnd STaR improves over both\\na few-shot baseline (+35.9%) and a baseline ﬁne-tuned to directly predict answers (+12.5%) , and\\nperforms comparably to a ﬁne-tuned model that is 30× larger (72.5% vs. 73.0%).\\nThus, we make the following contributions:\\n1. We propose a bootstrapping mechanism to iteratively generate a rationale dataset from a few\\ninitial examples with rationales—without needing to check new rationales’ correctness.\\n2. We complement rationale generation with rationalization, where a model is tasked with\\njustifying an answer and then ﬁne-tuned as if it had come up with the rationale without any\\nhint. We show rationalization accelerates and improves the bootstrapping process.\\n3. We evaluate these techniques with a variety of ablations in both mathematical and common-\\nsense reasoning domains.\\n4. We propose what is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst technique to allow a pre-trained large\\nlanguage model to iteratively use its language modeling capacity to improve itself.\\n2'),\n",

In essence, in-context learning treats\\nfew-shot learning as a language modeling problem, by showing a few examples in the context (i.e.\\nprompt), and allowing the model to learn and identify the pattern to apply to new examples. Some\\nhave studied in-context learning based on the language modeling objective in terms of Bayesian\\ninference [13] while others have attempted to describe the process more mechanistically in terms\\nof “induction heads” [ 14]. Moreover, differences in prompt conﬁgurations have been known to have\\ndramatic effects on few-shot performance. Some have even found that replacing few-shot prompts\\nwith a “soft prompt” which can be optimized in embedding space results in noticeable gains [ 15].\\nInstead of emphasizing the representation of the question, we focus on the model output; in particular,\\nwe focus on the model’s ability to reason through a problem before coming to a conclusion.\\nRationales One of the initial works on the impact of rationales on language model performance was\\n[3], showing that training a language model on a dataset with explicit rationales preceding the answer\\ncould improve a model’s ability to generate the ﬁnal answer. However, this required many thousands\\nof training examples to be manually annotated with human reasoning. Recently, [5] demonstrated\\nthat step-by-step “scratchpads” can improve ﬁne-tuned LLM performance and generalization on\\ntasks such as arithmetic, polynomial evaluation, and program evaluation. Similarly, [6] used a single\\nfew-shot “chain-of-thought” reasoning prompt in order to improve model performance on a collection\\nof tasks, without ﬁne-tuning. Finally, [16] showed that a curriculum learning approach could help\\nsolve formal math problems, as long as 1) they were translated into Lean (a theorem-proving language\\n[17]), 2) one could directly evaluate the validity of the proofs, 3) one could sample numerous potential\\nsolutions for each problem, 4) had trained a separate value function model, and 5) started with GPT-f\\n(a model already ﬁne-tuned on a large math dataset [18]). We note that there are many domains where\\nthese conditions do not all apply. In addition, works have aimed to explain why rationales have this\\nbeneﬁcial effect: some have analyzed their impact from the perspective of latent variable models [19]\\nwhile others have provided formal proofs of the beneﬁt of intermediate task supervision [20].\\nIterated Learning A variety of iterated learning algorithms have been proposed, where solutions\\nor successful methods which are found are in turn used to ﬁnd additional solutions [21, 22, 16]. [21]\\nintroduced Expert Iteration (ExIt), a reinforcement learning technique serving as an inspiration for\\nour approach. Essentially, it consists of a loop of self-play by an “apprentice,” followed by imitation\\nlearning with feedback from a slower “expert” and then the replacement of the expert with the now-\\nimproved apprentice. [16] builds off of ExIt for formal reasoning, while [22] applies iterated learning\\nto visual question answering using modular networks which can be combined compositionally. There\\nare further similarities between STaR and expert iteration methods [ 21]. For example, ﬁltering\\ngenerated examples based on whether their ultimate answer matches the target can be seen as expert\\nfeedback. However, we have a ﬁxed “expert” and do not train a separate value function.\\nNatural Language Explanations Natural language explanations have also been discussed from the\\nperspective of explainable machine learning, focusing on justiﬁcation rather than reasoning [23, 24].\\nThe motivation for this line of work is largely grounded in explainable decision making, and similarly\\nto [3], generally does not ﬁnd that requiring post-hoc explanations improves model performance.\\n3 Method\\n3.1 Rationale Generation Bootstrapping (STaR Without Rationalization)\\nWe are given a pretrained LLM M and an initial dataset of problems x with answers y: D =\\n{(xi, yi)}D\\ni=1. Our technique starts with a small prompt set P of examples with intermediate ratio-\\nnales r: P = {(xp\\ni , rp\\ni , yp\\ni )}P\\ni=1, where P ≪ D (e.g. P = 10). Like standard few-shot prompting, we\\nconcatenate this prompt set to each example in D, i.e. xi = (xp\\n1, rp\\n1, yp\\n1, . . . , xp\\nP , rp\\nP , yp\\nP , xi), which\\nencourages the model to produce a rationale ˆri for xi followed by an answer ˆyi. We assume that\\nrationales that lead to correct answers are of better quality than those that lead to incorrect answers.\\nTherefore, we ﬁlter the generated rationales to include only the ones which result in the correct\\nanswer (ˆyi = yi). We ﬁne-tune the base modelM on this ﬁltered dataset, and then restart this process\\nby generating the new rationales with the newly ﬁne-tuned model. We keep repeating this process\\nuntil the performance plateaus. Note that during this process, once we collect a new dataset, we train\\nfrom the original pre-trained model M instead of continually training one model to avoid overﬁtting.\\nWe provide an outline of this algorithm in Algorithm 1.\\n3'),\n",

To see this, note\\nthat M can be viewed as a discrete latent variable model pM (y | x) = ∑\\nr p(r | x)p(y | x, r); in\\nother words, M ﬁrst samples a latent rationaler before predicting y. Now, given the indicator reward\\nfunction 1 (ˆy = y), the total expected reward across the dataset is\\nJ(M, X, Y ) =\\n∑\\ni\\nEˆri,ˆyi∼pM (·|xi)1 (ˆyi = yi), (1)\\n∇J(M, X, Y ) =\\n∑\\ni\\nEˆri,ˆyi∼pM (·|xi) [1 (ˆyi = yi) · ∇ log pM (ˆyi, ˆri | xi)] , (2)\\nwhere the gradient is obtained via the standard log-derivative trick for policy gradients. Note that\\nthe indicator function discards the gradient for all sampled rationales that do not lead to the correct\\nanswer yi: this is the ﬁltering process in STaR (Line 5). Thus, STaR approximatesJ by (1) greedily\\ndecoding samples of (ˆri, ˆyi) to reduce variance of this estimate (at the cost of potentially biased\\nexploration of rationales), and (2) taking multiple gradient steps on the same batch of data (similar\\nto some policy gradient algorithms [25]). These approximations make STaR a simple and broadly\\napplicable method that can be implemented with standard LLM training machinery; future work\\nshould more closely investigate the link between STaR and the RL objective above.\\n3.2 Rationalization\\nQ: Where do you put your grapes just\\nbefore checking out?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) mouth\\n(b) grocery cart (CORRECT)\\n(c) super market\\n(d) fruit basket\\n(e) fruit market\\nA: The answer should be the place\\nwhere grocery items are placed before\\nchecking out.

Since the model is only trained on\\nthe examples which it answers correctly, improve-\\nment ends when the model fails to solve new prob-\\nlems in the training set. This is fundamentally due\\nto the fact that the algorithm cannot obtain any train-\\ning signal from failed examples. Inspired by [3], we\\npropose a technique we call “rationalization”. Specif-\\nically, we provide the answer as a hint to the model\\nand ask it to generate rationales in the same style\\nas in the previous rationale generation step. Given\\nthe answer, the model is able to reason backwards,\\nand hence more easily generate a rationale that leads\\nto the correct answer. For example, in Figure 2, we\\nprovide the hint that ”(b) grocery cart” is the cor-\\nrect answer in the prompt to generate the rationale.\\nWe apply rationalization to the problems which the\\nmodel failed to solve with rationale generation. When\\nadding a rationalization-generated rationale to our dataset, we do not include the hint in its corre-\\nsponding prompt, as if the model had come up with the rationale without the hint.

In particular, for arithmetic, we follow a setup inspired by [ 5]. For\\ncommonsense question-answering we follow [13, 6] and use CommonsenseQA (CQA), a widely\\nused multiple-choice dataset for this domain [10]. For grade school math, we use GSM8K from [9].\\n4.1 Experimental Protocol\\nWe used GPT-J as our base language model, and the ﬁne-tuning script from the GPT-J repository\\n[26]. We chose GPT-J, a 6B-parameter model, because the checkpoint and ﬁne-tuning code are\\npublicly available [26], and the model is large enough to generate rationales of non-trivial quality to\\nbe bootstrapped from. More hyperparameter details about GPT-J and our ﬁne-tuning are included\\nin Appendix H.

Unless stated otherwise, we start with 40 training\\nsteps at the ﬁrst outer loop, and increase the number of ﬁne-tuning training steps by20% with each\\nouter loop. In general, we found that training more slowly at the beginning ultimately beneﬁts\\nmodel performance. We expect that further improvement is possible via a thorough hyperparameter\\nsearch—we leave this to future work due to computational constraints.\\nFor arithmetic problems, we ﬁrst generate a dataset of 50,000 randomly sampled questions (uniformly\\nover the digit lengths) in the format introduced by [5]. For each outer loop iteration on arithmetic,\\nwe sample 10,000 problems from the dataset. We use 10 random few-shot rationale examples for\\neach digit for its corresponding few-shot prompt. For each of the 9, 741 questions in the training set\\nof CommonsenseQA, we add the question to the few-shot rationale prompt, and prompt the model\\nto generate the rationale and answer for that question. For few shot prompting on CQA, we start\\nwith the same 10 questions as used in [ 6], with the rationales modiﬁed slightly to ﬁx an incorrect\\nanswer and to more explicitly reference relevant knowledge. We include these modiﬁed prompts in\\nAppendix B1. These prompts serve as our complete set of explanations. We run STaR until we see\\nperformance saturate, and we report the best results.\\nWhen performing rationalization, we ﬁnd that the choice to include or omit few-shot prompts on\\nouter-loop iterations after the ﬁrst iteration does not have a substantial impact on the method’s ultimate\\nperformance. However, there are some nuances which we discuss further in Section 5, leading us to\\nuse few-shot prompts unless stated otherwise.\\n4.2 Datasets\\nInput:\\n6 2 4 + 2 5 9\\nTarget:\\n<scratch>\\n6 2 4 + 2 5 9 , C: 0\\n2 + 5 , 3 C: 1\\n6 + 2 , 8 3 C: 0\\n, 8 8 3 C: 0\\n0 8 8 3\\n</scratch>\\n8 8 3\\nFigure 3: A visualization of\\na 3-digit arithmetic problem\\nwith a scratchpad.

We generate the dataset based on the descriptions\\nin [5] and visualize an example scratchpad in Figure 3. Everything\\nup to and including “ Target:” is given as part of a prompt, and\\nthe model is asked to generate the scratchpad (start/end indicated\\nby “ <scratch>”) and the ﬁnal answer, as in [5]. Each line of the\\nscratchpad corresponds to the summation of each pair of digits from\\nthe ﬁnal digit to the ﬁrst digit, the accumulating ﬁnal digits of the\\nanswer, and a carry digit corresponding to whether the previous pair\\nsummed to at least 10. We include few-shot prompts for 1 to 5 digits.\\nWhen performing rationalization, we include the correct answer after\\n“ Target” and query the model to produce the scratchpad and then\\nreproduce the correct answer following the scratchpad.\\nCommonsenseQA The multiple-choice commonsense reasoning\\ntask, CommonsenseQA [10] (CQA), is constructed from ConceptNet, a semantic graph of concepts\\nand their relationships with over a million nodes [28]. [10] identiﬁed a set of “target” concepts in\\nConceptNet for each question, where the target concepts share a semantic relationship to one “source”\\nconcept. Then each question is crowdsourced to allow a reader to identify one target concept, while\\nmentioning the source concept. In addition, two distractor answers are added. The dataset has 12,247\\nquestions, each with ﬁve choices, with 9,741 in the train set, 1,221 in the dev set, and 1,285 in the\\n(withheld) test set.\\n1Based on [27], this is unlikely to meaningfully affect [6]’s few-shot performance.\\n5'),\n",

In the arithmetic task,\\nan incorrect scratchpad in the reasoning step, and to a lesser degree in the rationalization step, was\\nextremely likely to result in an incorrect answer. On the other hand, CQA problems are 5-way\\nmultiple choice questions. Thus, one will get the right answer at random approximately 20% of\\nthe time, regardless of the quality of reasoning. Moreover, some simple heuristics (e.g. semantic\\nsimilarity) can meaningfully improve this to ≈30% without any reasoning, as shown by [10].\\nWe evaluate this dataset as described in the experimental protocol and compare to several baselines.\\nThe ﬁrst baseline is to ﬁnetune GPT-J to directly output the ﬁnal answer, which we call “GPT-J\\nFinetuned”. We also compare to GPT-3 ﬁnetuned to directly predict the ﬁnal answer from [29], and a\\n137B parameter Lambda model few-shot prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from [6].\\nWe found that, as shown in Table 1, STaR without rationalization outperformed GPT-J ﬁne-tuned\\ndirectly on the ﬁnal answer for the entire dataset, despite training on less of the data. The inclusion of\\nrationalization improved this performance to 72.5%, far closer to the 73% of the 30× larger GPT-3.\\nAs expected, we also see STaR surpassed the few-shot baselines, including the much-larger 137B\\nLaMDA model [30, 6]. We expect accuracy would be further improved if we applied STaR to a\\nmodel with higher few-shot performance.\\nCase Study Note that it is harder to judge the rationale quality: for arithmetic, one can compare\\nthem to the ground truth rationales, but for CQA the evaluation is necessarily qualitative. For this\\nreason, we include a case study in Figure 7. We observe that the rationales provided are generally\\ncoherent and of a similar structure to the few-shot rationales. We make the following two observations:\\n1. After training with STaR, we see the model was able to generate reasonable rationales that\\nsolve new problems, which explains part of the observed performance gain.\\n2. We also see that there were many instances in which STaR improved the quality of rationales\\nover those generated in a few-shot manner.\\nHuman Evaluation Based on the observation that STaR may improve reasoning quality for prob-\\nlems even when they were initially answered correctly via few-shot prompting, we performed a\\npreliminary qualitative analysis. We randomly selected 50 rationales generated from few-shot CoT\\nand STaR-generated rationales on questions which they both answered correctly, as well as human-\\ngenerated rationales for these problems from [3]. We then presented a random subset of 10 questions\\nand rationales to each of 20 crowdworkers on Proliﬁc [31] with the rationales in a randomized order,\\nasking them to rank the rationales based on which they felt best justiﬁed the answer. The participants\\nwere 30% more likely to rank the STaR-generated rationales higher than the few-shot rationales\\n(p = .039). This indicates that, as mentioned in the case study, STaR can improve the quality of\\nrationale generation.\\nWe also found that the participants were 74% more likely to prefer the STaR-generated rationales\\nover the human-generated rationales (p < .001). To be clear, we do not believe that this indicates\\nhuman-level rationale-generation performance. Instead, we feel that it speaks to the difﬁculty of\\neliciting high-quality rationales. We reproduce the test prompts in Appendix C and elaborate on the\\nlimitations of the crowdsourced explanations dataset.\\n3We use the same few-shot rationales as described in Section 4.1 - namely ﬁxing typos and improving clarity.\\n7'),\n",

We observe\\nthat on this task, the use of rationalization does not\\nsubstantially improve performance. Note that, in\\ntraining, it was necessary to cap the number of train-\\ning steps at the 30th iterations (after 7912 steps),\\nto prevent the training process from becoming pro-\\nhibitively long. The results were reached after 36\\niterations for STaR without rationalization and an\\nadditional 10 iterations with rationalization.\\nMost often, the number of calculation steps gen-\\nerated by the model matches the number of steps\\ntaken by humans (generally between 53% and 57%\\nagreement across all iterations). We visualize this\\nexplicitly in Figure 6. We see that when the ground\\ntruth and model disagree on the number of calcu-\\nlation steps, the model typically uses fewer. Sometimes this is because the model skips steps, but\\noccasionally it ﬁnds different solutions. We show an example in Appendix J, where the model\\ndisregards redundant information and solves a 7-step problem in a single step.\\n5 Discussion and Challenges\\nThe Impact of Rationalization An essential question is exactly what role rationalization plays.\\nIntuitively, rationalization allows a model to reverse-engineer a solution, or provides a heuristic for\\nidentifying whether each step makes the conclusion more likely. This parallels real-world problems\\nwhere the ﬁnal result is known, but challenging to derive a good justiﬁcation. From a mathematical\\nperspective, while rationale generation samples rationales from the distribution p(r | x) provided by\\nour model M, rationalization conditions on the answer, letting us access an alternative distribution\\np(r | x, y) which may be a better search space for rationales. Then rationalization could be framed as\\nan off-policy estimate of the objective in Equation 1, sampling from the hint-augmented model as a\\nproposal distribution. Future work should establish more connections between rationalization and\\nthese RL objectives, and examine more generally when and why rationalization improves learning.\\n8'),\n",

This results in these examples\\nproviding a weaker gradient signal than the rationalization examples, at least in the ﬁrst iteration.\\nSince we retrain from the initial pre-trained model every time we run a ﬁne-tuning iteration, the\\ndegree of this effect is also difﬁcult to measure directly. Finally, we must point out that the method\\nto add the “hint” does not follow immediately from the question and answer and in some contexts\\nproviding it may be nontrivial. An exploration of the various impacts of different hinting techniques\\nand their generality is an avenue for future work.\\nTemperature One intuitive alternative to rationalization, if one seeks to expand the training dataset,\\nis more and higher-temperature sampling. However, in practice, we found that this is counterpro-\\nductive. In general, it substantially increases the likelihood of a correct answer despite incorrect\\nreasoning, and training on bad or irrelevant reasoning prevents generalization. This is particularly\\nclear in more structured tasks, like arithmetic, where the scratchpads that the model learns to produce\\nwith a higher-temperature sampling approach diverge into meaninglessness and cause the model to\\nstagnate. Overall, we found that higher temperatures as an alternative to rationalization (e.g. 0.5\\nor 0.7) consistently led to models worse than models with reasoning alone. In addition, as text\\ngeneration by large language models is sequential (i.e. one cannot produce a token without producing\\nthe preceding token), generating text is a bottleneck and this is computationally far less efﬁcient\\nthan rationalization. For example, generating 10 sample outputs is approximately 10 times slower\\nthan generating one sample output. However, one potentially valuable way to leverage multiple\\nsamples would be to use the method proposed in [32], using the majority-vote result of multiple high-\\ntemperature scratchpads as a ground truth against which we compare a low-temperature scratchpad.\\nThis may allow one to apply STaR to a dataset of only questions, without answers.\\nFew-shot Prompting A noteworthy phenomenon is that the inclusion of few-shot prompting during\\nsampling seems to dramatically reduce “drift” where later rationales become increasingly dissimilar\\nfrom the initial few-shot set of rationales. One beneﬁt of this is that the model may be less constrained\\nby the quality and difﬁculty of the initial rationales, theoretically allowing it to generalize more. One\\npotentially negative consequence is that the style of the rationales may less-closely match the original\\nprompting style. Another beneﬁt is in terms of computational resources - a shorter prompt length\\nallows for a shorter sequence length when sampling. Technically, the point in training at which we\\n“disable” few-shot prompts is another hyperparameter which we could tune, but we leave this to future\\nwork. In addition, by leaving prompts out after the initial outer-loop iteration, the model tends to\\nperform gradually worse at rationalization as it trains for longer periods of time. As a result, it may\\nbe necessary to include some hints during training for long periods of time with this approach.\\nUltimately, the choice to include few-shot prompts in later iterations of training appears to depend on\\nthe use-case: when the goal is consistent adherence to a particular prompt style, which may beneﬁt\\nexplainability, include few-shot prompts in sampling; when the goal is a faster training loop, one may\\nremove them. Moreover, it is possible that with other datasets or larger models there is an impact on\\nperformance, so we encourage this to be generally treated as a hyperparameter.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe present the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), which iteratively improves a model’s ability to generate\\nrationales to solve problems. We few-shot prompt a model to solve many problems in a step-by-step\\nmanner by generating rationales, and then prompt it to rationalize the correct answer for problems\\nit gets wrong. We ﬁnetune on both the initially correct solutions and rationalized correct solutions,\\nand repeat the process. We ﬁnd that this technique signiﬁcantly improves the model’s generalization\\nperformance on both symbolic reasoning and natural language reasoning.\\nThere are several important limitations on STaR as presented. In order for the ﬁrst iteration of STaR\\nto succeed, few-shot performance must be above chance, implying that the initial model must be\\nbig enough to have some reasoning capabilities. For instance we found that GPT-2 was not able\\nto bootstrap from few-shot reasoning in even the arithmetic domain. A further limitation is that\\nsettings with a high level of chance performance (e.g. binary decisions) yield many poor rationales,\\nconfounding the STaR approach. An open problem is how to ﬁlter bad reasoning in these settings.\\nNonetheless, we believe using examples without reasoning to bootstrap reasoning is a very general\\napproach, and that STaR can serve as the basis of more sophisticated techniques across many domains.\\n9'),\n",

Note that all the ﬁnal answers are correct – however, we take issue with the reasoning\\nused in order to arrive at those answers.\\nA.1 Question Implies Answer\\nOne key failure case was answers in the form of “the answer must be something that is <question\\nproperty>. <answer> is <question property>. Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>.” In these\\ncases, the model fails to explain why the answer that it has chosen satisﬁes the question property.\\nQ: What might someone get from learning about science?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) headache\\n(b) see things differently\\n(c) increased knowledge\\n(d) accidents\\n(e) appreciation of nature\\nA: The answer must be something that someone would get from learning about\\nscience. Learning about science would increase knowledge. Therefore, the\\nanswer is increased knowledge (c).\\nThese rationales, while perhaps useful to the model, read to us as opaque and unexplanatory.\\nA.2 Begging the Question\\nA related but stronger version of the previous failure case, while less common, is particularly\\nuninsightful. Sometimes the model will imply the answer that it has chosen in its question.\\nQ: The christian rock band was on a large stage, the singer’s foot got caught\\non a wire and he had a small what?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) commit sin\\n(b) fail\\n(c) disobey\\n(d) stumble\\n(e) boo boo\\nA: The answer must be something that would cause the singer to stumble. The\\nsinger’s foot got caught on a wire, so he would stumble. Therefore, the\\nanswer is stumble (d).\\nA.3 Exercise to the Reader\\nA rare failure case is when the model ﬁnds it unnecessary to justify its answer. For example:\\nQ: Other than school or from text where can one gain knowledge?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) book\\n(b) class\\n(c) thinking\\n(d) head\\n(e) meeting\\nA: The answer must be a place where someone can gain knowledge other than\\nschool or from text. The answer is meeting (e).\\n13'),\n",

This leads to somewhat comical examples of reasoning. Part of the reason\\nfor this is that generally, there is an expectation that good rationales will leverage understanding of\\nmore general classes of objects and appeal to the relationship between those general classes and the\\nparticular instance. For example, the argument that “a person would typically feel exhilaration from\\nheights” is generally more compelling than the argument that “James would feel exhilaration from\\nheights.”\\nQ: A person’s hand hurts after hitting the bottle. What might happen to\\nthe bottle?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) alcoholism\\n(b) breaking\\n(c) fly\\n(d) nausea\\n(e) ticket\\nA: The answer must be something that happens to the bottle. The bottle is\\nbroken. Therefore, the answer is breaking (b).\\nQ: James loved climbing. What emotion might he feel from heights?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) exhaustion\\n(b) exhilaration\\n(c) falling down\\n(d) nervousness\\n(e) vertigo\\nA: The answer must be a feeling that would cause someone to climb a mountain.\\nJames would feel exhilaration from heights. Therefore, the answer is\\nexhilaration (b).\\nA.5 Red Herrings\\nSome errors in reasoning corresponded to the model making a statement which, while technically\\ntrue, is not useful in demonstrating the claim.\\nQ: A squirrel ran up to it’s home, where is the small dog likely to be\\nbarking up?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) manhattan apartment\\n(b) wood\\n(c) neighbor’s yard\\n(d) tree\\n(e) basket\\nA: The answer must be a place where a small dog would be likely to be\\nbarking. Squirrels are not small dogs. Therefore, the answer is tree (d).\\nQ: John ran very fast, his feet touched the ground in what way?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) behind\\n(b) loose\\n(c) feverishly\\n(d) slowly\\n(e) lightly\\nA: The answer must be a way of running that is different from the way John\\nran. Running is a fast, light-footed activity. Therefore, the answer is\\nlightly (e).\\n14'),\n",

The implication of this with a dataset like CommonsenseQA is that if biases are\\n“useful” in solving the dataset then they will be ampliﬁed. This is made worse by rationalization, as\\nbiased answers that the model may not naturally arrive at are, in a sense, pulled out of the model.\\nThe exact interaction between the bias in a dataset and the pre-existing bias learned by the model\\nis unclear, and something to consider before real-world deployment of all large language models in\\ngeneral, but STaR-trained models in particular.\\nWe ﬁnd some encouraging initial results on this however: for questions where gender is not relevant,\\nthe model appears to disregard it in its explanation. For example: “Q: Where is a good place for\\na woman to store her sunglasses? → A: The answer must be a place where sunglasses are stored.\\nSunglasses are stored in purses. Therefore, the answer is purse (e).” or “Q: The only baggage the\\nwoman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it? → A: The answer must be\\na place where a drawstring bag is checked. The answer is airport (e).” We believe this question\\nwarrants a much more comprehensive study.\\nOne important challenge with models which seek to be interpretable or provide explanations for\\ntheir reasoning is that of faithfulness. While our primary emphasis is not on the explainability\\nbeneﬁts that STaR may bring, there is a fundamental challenge around evaluating explanations\\nand rationales: namely, faithfulness [ 33, 34]. [ 34] describe faithful explanations as those which\\n“accurately [represent] the reasoning process behind the model’s prediction.” While STaR encourages\\nthe use of reasoning in rationales which leads the model to correct answers, it is difﬁcult, if not\\nimpossible, to ensure that the rationales reﬂect the model’s internal processing. For example, it is\\nstraightforward to imagine the model implicitly selecting a particular answer immediately and then\\ngenerating a rationale to justify that selected answer. This would allow a model to generate unbiased\\nrationales while selecting answers in a biased way.\\nThe fact that our model outperforms one ﬁne-tuned to directly predict the answers, and ablation\\nstudies from papers such as [6] make it clear that the generation of a rationale before producing an\\nanswer non-trivially improves the model’s answer quality. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the\\ndegree to which any particular answer’s rationale is faithful. However, we note that there problems\\nare not unique to STaR, but are symptomatic of the difﬁculty of understanding large language models\\nand in particular the rationales generated by large language models.\\nH Hyperparameters\\nGPT-J is a 28-layer decoder-only transformer, with an embedding size of 1024, 16 attention heads of\\ndimension 256, and an FFN hidden layer of size 16384.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\\n3'),\n",

DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data ,\\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\\nSpecifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · ·, 𝑜𝐺} from the old\\npolicy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:\\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃) = E[𝑞 ∼ 𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\\n𝑖=1 ∼ 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑂|𝑞)]\\n1\\n𝐺\\n𝐺∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n\\x12\\nmin\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞) 𝐴𝑖, clip\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞) , 1 − 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀\\n\\x13\\n𝐴𝑖\\n\\x13\\n− 𝛽D𝐾 𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃|| 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓\\n\\x01\\x13\\n, (1)\\nD𝐾 𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃|| 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓\\n\\x01 =\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) − log\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) − 1, (2)\\nwhere 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴𝑖 is the advantage, computed using a group of\\nrewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, . . . , 𝑟𝐺} corresponding to the outputs within each group:\\n𝐴𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 − m𝑒𝑎𝑛({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · ·, 𝑟𝐺})\\ns𝑡𝑑 ({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · ·, 𝑟𝐺}) .

Reward Modeling\\nThe reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL.\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two\\ntypes of rewards:\\n• Accuracy rewards: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct.\\nFor example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required\\nto provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable\\nrule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be\\nused to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\\n• Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward\\nmodel that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’\\ntags.\\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,\\nbecause we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale\\nreinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training\\nresources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\\n2.2.3. Training T emplate\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides\\nthe base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template\\nrequires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.\\nWe intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific\\nbiases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-\\ngies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL\\nprocess.\\n2.2.4.

To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the\\nopen community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly\\ncold-start data.\\n2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can\\nreasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small\\namount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that\\nnot only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong\\ngeneral capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The\\npipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\\n2.3.1. Cold Start\\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from\\nthe base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data\\nto fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several\\napproaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting\\nmodels to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human\\nannotators.\\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as\\nthe starting point for RL.

Here, we define the output format as\\n|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning\\nprocess is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning\\nresults.\\n• Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we\\nobserve better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is\\na better way for reasoning models.\\n2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale\\nreinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses\\non enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such\\nas coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with\\nclear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,\\nparticularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language\\nmixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated\\nas the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show\\nthat such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward\\naligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of\\nreasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the\\nfinal reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence\\non reasoning tasks.\\n2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT\\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which\\nprimarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the\\nmodel’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we\\ngenerate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\\nReasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-\\ning rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,\\nwe only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,\\nwe expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward\\nmodel by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.\\nAdditionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have\\nfiltered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks.

In the end, we collected a total of\\napproximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning.\\nWe fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about\\n800k samples.\\n2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios\\nTo further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement\\nlearning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultane-\\nously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination\\nof reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the\\nmethodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the\\nlearning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to\\nreward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build\\nupon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and train-\\ning prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the\\nassessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing\\ninterference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire\\nresponse of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and\\nmitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation\\nprocess. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us\\nto train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.\\n2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability\\nTo equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly\\nfine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using\\nthe 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in §2.3.3. Our findings indicate that\\nthis straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller\\nmodels. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-\\n14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its\\nreasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.\\nFor distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though\\nincorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL\\nstage to the broader research community.\\n3. Experiment\\nBenchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema\\net al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al.,\\n2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al.,\\n2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI,\\n11'),\n",

In addition to standard benchmarks, we\\nalso evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we\\nadhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li\\net al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we\\nonly feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we\\nreport representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and\\nLiveCodeBench.\\nEvaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as\\nMMLU, DROP , GPQA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-\\nevals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a\\nzero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts\\nare few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot\\nmay hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation\\nprotocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the\\nHumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++,\\nC#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP , and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated\\nusing CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces\\ndataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases,\\nafter which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench\\nverified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related\\nbenchmarks are measured using a \"diff\" format.

For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).\\nEvaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models.\\nWe found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in\\nhigher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we\\ndefault to pass@𝑘 evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature.\\nSpecifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top- 𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘\\nresponses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question.

Additionally, DeepSeek-R1\\nexcels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis\\ncapabilities.

A similar trend is observed where\\nOpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than\\nDeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse\\nanswering certain queries after safety RL.

These improvements can be linked to the inclusion\\nof instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL\\ntraining. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard,\\nindicating DeepSeek-R1’s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its\\nsignificant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale\\nRL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse\\ndomains.

However, DeepSeek-R1-\\nDistill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.\\nTherefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller\\nones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in\\nthis paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance\\nof distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing\\nbeyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-\\nscale reinforcement learning.\\n4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts\\nIn the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along\\nthe way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that\\nthese approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\\nProcess Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better\\napproaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\\n2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\\nability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\\net al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\\nintroduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\\nMonte Carlo T ree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-\\nver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time\\ncompute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training.

To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\\nnode, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\\ndirectly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\\nTraining a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\\nmodel to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to\\nprogressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\\ndue to the complexities of token generation.\\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\\npre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\\nsignificant challenge.\\n5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\\nlearning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\\ndata, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\\nleveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\\nWe further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use\\nDeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small\\ndense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o\\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other\\ndense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-\\ntuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\\n• General Capability: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3\\nin tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output.\\nMoving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in\\nthese fields.\\n• Language Mixing: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which\\nmay result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For\\ninstance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is\\nin a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future\\nupdates.\\n• Prompting Engineering: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive\\nto prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we\\nrecommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a\\nzero-shot setting for optimal results.\\n• Software Engineering T asks: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the effi-\\nciency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software\\nengineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement\\nover DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address\\nthis by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating\\nasynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.\\n16'),\n",
